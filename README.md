# CRYPTOPALS in GO

## Objective
```
This is my own personal journey into the world of practical 
cryptography. The idea is to teach myself fundamental concepts,
research, dive into uncomfortable waters, and solve all of the 
challenge sets. All solutions will be written in the GO development
language. 
```


## Documentation
```
A single readme would be insanely massive and over complicated.
Instead each set's sub-challenge will have a dedicated readme to 
document the solution and so I don't forget what I did while 
having my out of body experience throughout solving some of these. 
Note that documentation is predicated on my own available time, so
I will get to each whenever feasible.
```

## Developing
```
More like actively solving challenges as I get time
```

## Thanks
```
The fine outstanding folks at Matasano for releasing these 
challenges to the public. Truly a wonderful resource!
